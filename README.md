Overview
supply chain management is a command-line utility designed to automate the renaming such as invoices, purchase orders, and shipment records. By standardizing file naming conventions, it enhances document organization and retrieval within SCM systems.
Features
•	Batch Renaming: Process multiple files simultaneously, applying consistent naming patterns.
•	Customizable Naming Patterns: Define naming conventions that include supplier codes, shipment dates, and document types.
•	File Type Filtering: Specify which file types (e.g., PDF, DOCX) to include or exclude from the renaming process.
•	Readability Options: Choose between concise or descriptive file names to suit organizational needs.
